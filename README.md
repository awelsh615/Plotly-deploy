# Plotly-deployment
The purpose of this project was to create a dynamic website that allows users to access their research results.  

The website features a dropdown menu allowing users to choose their Test Subject ID Number and display their demographic information along with several visualizations of their test resuults.  The first chart is a bubble chart displaying their results, which allows users to understand the data in an easily visible and readable way.

The second visualization is a bar chart displaying the name and amount of the top 10 bacteria found in their belly button.  The third visualization is a gauge chart displaying their personal amount of belly button washes per week.  I can only assume this graphic is included to shame users into washing more frequently. :-)
